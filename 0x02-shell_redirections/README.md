# 0x02. Shell, I/O Redirections and filters
This projects teaches the topic of she;; redirections, which are powerful techniques used in the unix shell to control output and input streams of commands. Shell redirections allow us to redirect input from files, redirect output to files, and manipulate files.

## Learning Objective
- input / output redirection
- Standaard input, output and error
- Redirection operators: `>`,`>>`,`<`,`<<`,`|`,`2>`,`2>&1`
- Creatin, appending to, and reading from files
- Understanding file descriptors and their usage

## Files and Directors
The project includes the following files and directories:
- `0-hello_world`: A script that prints "Hello, World"
- `1-confused_smiley`: A script that displays a confused smiley `"(Ã”o)'` to the standard output.
